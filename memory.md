# Project Memory

## Project Overview
- **Name**: AENEAS - Crypto Trading Signal Verification System
- **Type**: AI-powered cryptocurrency trading signal analysis platform
- **Status**: 76% complete - Phase 1-4 done, Phase 5 Performance Tracking & ML Pipeline complete
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Kafka, Docker

## Architecture Decisions
- **Async Framework**: FastAPI with full async/await support for high performance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application can run without non-critical services (Kafka, Telegram, LLM)
- **Service Isolation**: Each service runs in Docker container with health checks
- **Configuration Management**: Pydantic-based settings with environment validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for Qdrant operations (100 req/min)
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for market data and signal caching with TTL

## Dependencies
- **Core**: fastapi==0.109.0, uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0, pydantic==2.5.3
- **Database**: asyncpg==0.29.0, sqlalchemy==2.0.25, alembic==1.13.1
- **Messaging**: aiokafka==0.10.0, telethon==1.34.0
- **AI/ML**: openai==1.8.0, langchain==0.1.0, qdrant-client==1.7.0, tiktoken==0.5.2
- **Market Data**: yfinance==0.2.33, ta-lib==0.6.7, aiohttp==3.9.1
